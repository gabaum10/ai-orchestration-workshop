## Primary Exercise: AI Training Program Proposal

Use this document if you don't have your own work to review. This proposal has deliberate gaps and blind spots that a Challenger persona should identify.

## MEMORANDUM

**TO:** Executive Leadership Team
**FROM:** Sarah Chen, VP of Learning & Development
**DATE:** February 9, 2026
**RE:** Proposal for Enterprise-Wide AI Skills Training Program

### Executive Summary

As artificial intelligence becomes increasingly integrated into business operations, our workforce needs comprehensive training to leverage these tools effectively. I propose implementing a company-wide AI Skills Training Program to increase employee productivity and maintain our competitive edge.

This initiative will roll out over six months, beginning Q2 2026, with an initial investment of $185,000. Expected outcomes include measurable productivity gains, improved employee satisfaction, and positioning our organization as an employer of choice for tech-savvy talent.

### Background

Recent surveys indicate that 73% of knowledge workers now use AI tools in some capacity, yet most lack formal training. Our employees are adopting ChatGPT, Copilot, and other AI assistants on their own, often without understanding best practices, limitations, or organizational policies around data usage.

We have an opportunity to formalize AI adoption through structured training, ensuring employees use these tools safely, effectively, and in alignment with company objectives.

### Objective

Develop internal AI literacy across all departments, enabling employees to:
- Use AI tools effectively for their specific roles
- Understand capabilities and limitations of current AI technology
- Apply AI to improve productivity in daily work
- Collaborate with AI-augmented colleagues and teams

### Proposed Approach

**Phase 1 (Months 1-2): Foundation**
- Develop core curriculum covering AI basics, prompt engineering, and common use cases
- Identify internal champions to serve as AI ambassadors
- Create self-paced learning modules accessible via our LMS

**Phase 2 (Months 3-4): Department-Specific Training**
- Customize content for key departments (Sales, Marketing, Engineering, Operations, Finance)
- Deliver live workshops facilitated by external consultants
- Establish office hours for hands-on support

**Phase 3 (Months 5-6): Integration & Scaling**
- Launch internal community of practice
- Collect feedback and iterate on content
- Measure adoption rates and productivity gains

### Timeline

- **March 2026:** Curriculum development begins
- **April 2026:** Pilot program with volunteer cohort (50 employees)
- **May-June 2026:** Department-specific rollout (Sales, Marketing, Engineering)
- **July-August 2026:** Company-wide availability, remaining departments
- **September 2026:** Program evaluation and iteration

### Budget

| Item | Cost |
|------|------|
| External curriculum development | $45,000 |
| Learning management system integration | $15,000 |
| Live workshop facilitation (10 sessions) | $50,000 |
| Internal resource allocation (200 hours @ $150/hr) | $30,000 |
| AI tool licenses (enterprise tier, 6 months pilot) | $35,000 |
| Marketing and communications | $10,000 |
| **Total Initial Investment** | **$185,000** |

### Expected Outcomes

**Productivity:** Employees will increase productivity by leveraging AI for routine tasks such as drafting communications, data analysis, research, and content creation.

**Engagement:** Offering cutting-edge skills development will improve employee satisfaction scores and reduce turnover, particularly among early-career employees who value continuous learning.

**Innovation:** A workforce fluent in AI tools will generate new ideas for process improvement and customer value creation.

**Competitive Advantage:** Organizations that upskill employees for the AI era will attract and retain top talent while outperforming competitors who lag in adoption.

### Success Metrics

- 80% of employees complete foundation training within 6 months
- Employee satisfaction scores increase by 10 points on annual survey
- Productivity increases measurable through self-reported time savings
- Internal community of practice reaches 200+ active members

### Recommendation

I recommend approving this program with a Q2 2026 start date. Early adoption of AI training will position us ahead of competitors and demonstrate our commitment to employee development.

The landscape is shifting rapidly. Companies that invest in AI literacy now will lead their industries. Those that wait will struggle to catch up.

I'm available to discuss this proposal in detail and answer any questions.

## Alternative Scenarios (Brief)

Use these if the AI Training Program proposal doesn't fit your context. These are intentionally shorter - just enough for a Challenger to work with.

### Alternative 1: Product Launch Proposal

**Context:** You're proposing to launch a premium tier of your SaaS product six months ahead of the original roadmap.

**The Pitch:**
Our enterprise customers are asking for advanced analytics features we planned for next year. I propose accelerating the premium tier launch to Q3 2026 instead of Q1 2027. We can capture market share before competitors ship similar capabilities. The dev team estimates 4-5 months to build core features. Budget requirement: $120K for additional engineering resources and $30K for launch marketing. We'll price the premium tier at $299/month vs. our current $99/month standard plan. Based on current customer requests, we project 15% of our base will upgrade in the first quarter, generating $180K in incremental revenue.

### Alternative 2: Budget Increase Request

**Context:** You're the head of customer support requesting a 40% budget increase to expand your team.

**The Request:**
Customer support volume has grown 60% year-over-year while headcount remained flat. Our average response time has increased from 4 hours to 11 hours, and customer satisfaction scores dropped 8 points. I'm requesting budget to add five support specialists ($350K annually) and implement a ticketing system upgrade ($45K one-time). This will restore our 4-hour response time target and improve CSAT scores back to historical levels. The alternative is continued degradation of customer experience, which puts retention at risk - we've already seen churn increase 3% this quarter, likely tied to support delays.

### Alternative 3: Process Change Recommendation

**Context:** You're recommending that your organization shift from annual performance reviews to quarterly check-ins.

**The Recommendation:**
Our current annual performance review process is misaligned with how we actually work. Employees receive feedback once per year about projects that happened 6-12 months ago. I propose shifting to quarterly check-ins: 30-minute structured conversations between managers and direct reports focused on recent work, growth areas, and goals for the next quarter. This aligns with how our engineering and product teams already operate in sprints. Implementation requires updating our HR system ($8K), training managers on the new format (2-day workshop, ~$15K), and revising our performance documentation templates. Expected benefits: more timely feedback, better alignment on priorities, reduced anxiety around annual reviews, and improved retention of high performers who currently feel they lack regular development conversations.

## Workshop Instructions

When using any of these scenarios:

1. **Read the document carefully** - imagine you received it as a stakeholder reviewing the proposal
2. **Start with your Challenger persona** - identify blind spots, unstated assumptions, gaps in logic, and risks
3. **Move to your Executor persona** - use the handoff template to brief it with the Challenger's findings, then produce improved output (revised proposal, risk assessment, implementation plan, etc.)
4. **Compare results** - how does the pipeline output differ from a single-prompt review?

The goal is to experience the difference between specialized, sequential prompts and a single generalist prompt.
